 GLFW
================================================================================

This is a set of Go bindings for GLFW.

GLFW is a small C library that lets you create and manage an OpenGL context and
its associated window, enumerate and change display modes, as well as handle
inputs such as keyboard, mouse, joystick and time.

GLFW provides a thin, multi-platform abstraction layer, primarily for
applications whose sole graphics output is through the OpenGL API. While GLFW is
very useful when developing multi-platform OpenGL applications, single-platform
developers can also benefit from avoiding the drudgery of kludgy platform-
specific APIs.

This wrapper targets GLFW 2.7

We do not implement the thread/mutex api.
Callback functions are working.
